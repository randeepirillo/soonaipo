                            <p> I also am unfollowing porn stars as they come up on insta gram. I followed several and don‚Äôt know who they all are. I‚Äôve likely unfollowed about 15-20 Facebook and Instagram changes - 4/5/18 To keep users‚Äô information safe and secure, Facebook is changing the way all partners like Hootsuite access data. We are in full support of these changes because we believe they are critical to maintaining trust between our customers and their customers. Some of these changes have impacted or will impact Hootsuite functionality. As of April 4th, changes to the Facebook and Instagram APIs have impacted Hootsuite in the following ways: Facebook: Facebook. Why did Facebook neuter interacting with users through third-party tools? I can no longer interact with users within HootSuite. Which is a HUGE blow to my productivity. It's fucking infuriating. Rant over. Edit: Guess I'm not done. It doesn't stop the big players from bending the rules, they'll just hire more people. It only hurts us small agencies that put in 12 hours a day to make sure everything is working. Edit 2: Here‚Äôs what started me raging this morning. ‚ÄúTo keep users‚Äô informati. because I don't want to see the congratulations class of '23 stuff but also out of pettiness. Anyone know why the stopped following him. As far as I am aware they still have a good relationship after him performing at the fortnite party at last years E3, his song everyday feat marshmellow being played at the pleasant park concert and also his shout-out to the game in his recent song Keanu Reaves. Seems a bit rude considering they now also follow marshmellow. Intro This is a story about social media dynamics, and will probably sound trivial. But I have time on my hands and want to poll the crowd on this, because I'm genuinely unsure how right I am here. amp#x200B; Backstory I've known this person almost a year. We dated when we first met, but things didn't work out due to circumstances and we split up amicably, and remained friends. Some drunk texts/sexts to each other since, but none for the past few months. The friend is passionate. 
Just casually browsing Instagram at 3am and noticed that Leah is no longer following Jason on Instagram. She also posted in stories that she‚Äôll be deleting a ‚Äúton of photos‚Äù from her page. Hmm. üßêüßêüßêüßê. My friend believes in the zodiac. That's fine, I have no problem with it. I've said I don't believe in it but I follow an account she does so she can send me things. √å don't mind with that because they're actually rather entertaining, even if I think they're bullshit. The problem arises when the account posts more ads than horoscope things. I told my friend I'm unfollowing it due to it annoying me and that if she wanted to send me stuff I was still okay with it but she'd have to screenshot. And you can sign a new contract just by following a t-shirt company. my app would unfollow some people automatically. i'm pretty sure im not hacked/not sharing my account with another person. the app makes me unfollow people without my consent. edit: theres this person who i know and follow. this app made me unfollow them. i know this becsuse theyre account now reads as private even tho i NEVER unfollow. I‚Äôve had a good friend for about 2.5 years now and she‚Äôs always been sort of into her Instagram. She‚Äôs smart and kind, but also socially anxious and pretty self-centered. Like not selfish, just self-centered. I unfollowed her Instagram recently and got confronted on it. The last year or two she has gotten more into the Instagram and into this idea of being an influencer and into her ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù. All with this light pink filter into this very ideal life of hers that frankly isn‚Äôt that accurate. Throwaway, because some of my friends know my main account. amp#x200B; My girlfriend is currently mad at me and not picking up her phone, so I decided to make a post on here, just to check if I am morally justified in my actions. Here¬¥s what happened: We (my girlfriend and I) were just hanging out on our phones, when I opened Instagram and the first thing that popped up was a rather revealing picture of a (previously close, now not so close but still in regular contact) female friend. Who came up with the idea that it's good marketing to follow/unfollow your fans? I think it is such an idiotic thing to do. I don't know if they just like and follow everyone that uses a certain hashtag, it's fully automated or an intern follows everyone who is suggested by the algorithm. amp#x200B; I don't think any dj or producer is interested in the stuff I do in my freetime ( and that's okay! ) but somehow it makes a 'star' much more genuine if he tries to connect with his fanbase 
I noticed the other day that my ex-best friend unfollowed me on Instagram, I guess her mom noticed and spoke to her, because following that her and a bunch of other witnesses unfollowed me as well. I faded a little over 2 years ago, I guess it‚Äôs finally happening. Haha! I haven‚Äôt really posted pictures of my girlfriend, but this gives me the perfect opportunity to gayify my insta. I‚Äôm very excited. Anyone remember that? Why can't I find her posts anymore. Was going well on 2 weeks no contact today. Was too afraid to unfollow her instagram account because once it's done it'd go private and I'd need to request access again if I ever wanted to see old posts of us together (I don't want to look at them, but Im' afraid that if I unfollow I'll lose those memories forever). amp#x200B; She posted something new and I've since muted her so I'm not unfollowed but it won't be appearing in my feed anymore. I'd prefer to learn to not look at what she's. I mean because I simply have no interest in looking at photos of her and I don't know her. I follow friends on instagram because I'd like to see what they're up to and photos of themselves, their art, and what they do with their friends and loved ones. But this guy posts nothing but photos of his girlfriend and her selfies that she sent to him. It's not even a joint account. Guy legit just wants to show off his new Asian girlfriend and I get that it's a sweet thing when your partner shows Wouldn't Chris have changed his profile picture on twitter to something else other than the 2 Lovely Uncles one? If they would go as far as to unfollow or something, it would only make sense to change your picture from something relating to SuperMega. </p>
