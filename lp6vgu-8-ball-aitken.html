With news of Lando Norris departing for F1, it's time to kick off the 2019 F2 silly season. I'll get the ball rolling with my (probably very wrong) predictions: Leaving Apart from Norris, Russell could join him in F1 or move to Merc's FE division. Albon moves on to pastures new (perhaps FE). Gunther moves to Formula E with Dragon. Nyck de Vries joins Audi in DTM/FE. Nicholas Latifi departs for the IndyCar scene. Markelov, Fuoco and Ghiotto depart for new pastures. Teams Carlin retain. У октаэдра 8 граней, 12 ребер, 6 вершин. Каждое ребро октаэдра - равносторонний  Geometric Ball with watercolour Design!

Hello everyone, it’s Round 22 and it’s easily our biggest Flashback yet- Unfortunately due to character restraints I’ve had to cut out some moments that I would have loved to put in- Such as Fitzroy's end, Barry Hall’s last kick as a Saint vs the Hawks, Hird & Sheedy’s farewell and the Lloyd hit (Though that has been covered enough). 1987- Mayhem and heartbreak Round 22 1987 is probably one of the greatest rounds of footy ever, purely for the dramatic twists and turns that played-.

St George Illawarra Dragons v Penrith Panthers noticed some market movement since opening getting abit more for panthers. always liked the panthers outfit but without soward this season wonder how they will travel with cleary leading the way. havent heard much about Te Maire Martin either. nevertheless i rate panthers pack cartwright, campbell gillard, yeo, merrin and new inclusion tamou. moylan will get alot of ball through the back line and watch his soft hands send players I love bmx and I love this subreddit. The only bummer is that it isn't as busy as I feel it could be. This is a great subreddit with great people in it and it's a shame it's not more busy. So I decided to TRY to start making some discussion topics everyday (is my hope at least) to try to create some activity. If you have any topics you'd like to see just pm me or post them yourself!
