About This Addon Module. This is a separated module which we decided to move it out from the main Atlas core addon starting from v1.21.0. World of Warcraft (WoW; с англ. — «Мир военного ремесла») — массовая многопользовательская ролевая. I found out that DISABLING ACCOUNTANT CLASSIC fixed the problem. I put in a ticket with the addon but after finding out it was this addon have informed you that you might fix it so I can turn this addon back on. Here is the ticket but somewhere in it the author said some addons use old libraries and they need updating.

My WoW friend recently convinced me to to install AAP (Azeroth Auto Pilot) , in order to speed up the leveling process of my alts on retail WoW. AAP is an extremely popular addon that's supposed to make you level faster, by automating some of the gameplay for you. I finally gave it a shot, and discovered why exactly it makes levelling faster. The addon does NOT remove the need to kill 8 wolves, or save 12 villagers, or any other repetitive activity. It does the following (all of which. СМОТРЕТЬ КИНО ОНЛАЙН!

I'm asking myself this question for quite some time and I'm still very unsure about what to expect in regards of WoW Addons in WoW Classic. amp#x200B; Like a lot of us I used certain addons back in the day but never really put any thought into what was needed for the development of an addon such as decursive or trinketmenu and many many others. At that point I didn't even know programming. Only during my time on Nostalrius I discovered my love for developing addons and started working sorry to you all for my bad english, i'm not native english speaker. amp#x200B; Will addons be usable when classic wow will be launched?. Hi all So I was thinking about one of the things that made classic great was that it had addon support, but at the same time addons remained relatively primitive back in the day. I remember having atlasloot and cartographer installed, with questhelper in tbc. I dont mind some QoL addons being made for classic, but i'm afraid that there will be many micromanaging addons made to the new release (please if someone is out there, don't create a new gearscore!) What are your thoughts? I'm kinda. I tend to be a minimalist with my addons, but some - including Atlas and Atlasloot, among a handful of others - are all but essential for me. Given the fact that classic WoW will be running on a modified 7.3.5 client, are people proactively working on re-writing popular vanilla addons for this modern API so that they'll be ready by release? amp#x200B; My understanding is that addons people are using for private servers won't work for Blizzard's version of vanilla WoW due to significant diffe. 
I'm trying to learn how to make some addons for retail WoW with the intent of porting them to Classic when the time comes, just to scratch my itch. With that being said, I may steal some ideas. I want to get into creating some custom addons for myself and friends in classic. Does anybody know any good resources to help get me started. Is it looking like we're going to be able to download the addons that are used by private server players right away in classic? From what I've gathered the game will be at the last patch when it launches, but content will be gated off to phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 amp 6 (correct me if I'm wrong). So the code or whatever should allow us to use any addons up to date with the last patch? amp#x200B; Personally I just want a quest addon, something for DPS and threat aswell as maybe some misc. stuff. There are some addons for vanilla that I think will depreciate the classic experience we asked for. I played on a vanilla server just to check it out, and all the hype directed me to all these addons for questing that people said were "necessary". It was so obvious which players had the addons and which didn't. The addon was called 'Questie' (i think), and essentially it shows you where all the quest givers are and also where the objectives are. Watching it, it seemed like any person who wasn'. If I understand correctly, classic servers will function on a Legion client skeleton that's been altered to look like patch 1.12. That's all fine, the game will be nice and smooth with fewer bugs than genuine 1.12 servers have. I wonder though, will some addons have to be re-written on launch? I'm sure for some addons like bagnon or bartender we can probably just use the Legion versions, but what about stuff like questhelper? Stuff that pertains to the old world specifically might Addons for World of Warcraft: Classic. I put together a Leveling Quest list that some people had expressed interest in. I generated this list with the intent that you could filter based on your faction and class selection and see all the quests of any given level. What is included: Most if not all the quests available for a player leveling 1-60 What is not included: Holidays, Darkmoon Faire, Raid Quests (excluding Onyxia Attunement and UBRS), repeatable Rep quests, Battlegrounds, and special events. I’m not a newbie but I’m not a pro either. Anyway, being a perfectionist and out of respect to the designers I play without addons. That is how the game is intended to play. Now I know I will get hate but why would you want something that was not made by the company that published the game? It is like overclocking an iMac. I think we should all play without addons. Sure, when blizzard decides something is useful they will add it. Like the quest location arrow. But we shouldn’t add it ourselves. Hello again fellow classic lovers, amp#x200B; I made another Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9PAMxwvMGg) which is part of my Druid Speedl Leveling/Bear Tanking Guide. This time the topic is Addons. Many things which are baseline in current Retail WoW weren't in Classic. The Video presents my UI with explanations to every Addon shown. amp#x200B; If you have any other Addons you would recommend everyone to use let me know! amp#x200B. 
So does anyone have any information about how AddOns that work for classic wow? Im not talking about Boss mods. Regarding mods such as UI changes, particularly raid frames for healers, AA swing timers, action bars, improved cast bars and so on, will these be allowed when classic wow is released? or will they even be compatible? Personally, I would like to keep the UI as vanilla as possible but there are certain things like improved raid frames and that are very important Anyone found a way to try out AddOns on the WoW Classic Demo client? To me it seems that AddOns are not loaded and the /script command is disabled. Edit: Also I'm interested how I'd best go about developing AddOns for Classic. Is it better to use a private server and develop for 1.12, or pick up the Starter Edition and develop it on current retail WoW? Which is likely to be more easily adapted My wife and I were talking about this after the announcemen, here's my take on why next summer and why making it free would make sense for the players and business wise as well. At the current wow time frame expansions release on the even years (legion 2016. Bfa 2018. Etc) there's patches throughout (ignore wod) and content placed through the lifetime of the expansion. The odd years are strange time for wow. There's content. But nothing too big. No major storylines are starting. They're finis. It's still a long time until classic WoW goes live so I'm planning on doing an extended immersive achievement hunting leveling challenge and I wonder if you know of addons which could help me get a bit more the classic-feeling back into retail wow, having an experience which has little of the convenience we have in retail WoW today. I don't want to create a copy experience to classic WoW, I just want to get as close to the feeling we had in those days as possible. How will addons work in Classic WoW? Will the vanilla ones I've been using for pservers still work, or will they all need to be updated since it runs on 7.3.5.
